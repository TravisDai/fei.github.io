Hello and welcome! I'm Travis Dai, a passionate educator and researcher serving as a lecturer at the Eastern Institute of Technology. With a deep-rooted fascination for the interplay between light and computation, my academic and professional journey revolves around harnessing optical technologies to revolutionize how we process information and communicate.

At the core of my research interests lie optical interconnect systemsâ€”a vital component for the next generation of high-speed, energy-efficient computing. I am deeply immersed in exploring parallel distributed computation of deep neural networks (DNN), aiming to unlock new horizons in computational speed and efficiency. My work on optical DNN accelerators is driven by the vision of creating groundbreaking hardware that can keep pace with the ever-growing demands of artificial intelligence and machine learning.

Communication optimization within these systems is another area where I focus my efforts, striving to enhance the way our devices and infrastructures converse in the digital age. The integration of embedded systems and the Internet of Things (IoT) into this framework forms the backbone of my approach towards creating a seamlessly connected world, where information flows as freely and efficiently as light itself.

I am constantly inspired by the potential of optical technologies to redefine our computational limits and am committed to advancing this field through rigorous research, innovative teaching, and collaborative exploration. Whether you're a student eager to delve into the wonders of optical computing, a fellow researcher keen on discussing potential collaborations, or simply curious about the future of technology, I invite you to join me on this exciting journey.
